Project Tasks:

1. Given a dataset in the file 'class.txt' which contains dirty data. 
2. Applied transformation rules like edit distance, jaccard similarity, Norton's spelling corrector in 'clean.py' for data cleaning.
3. The cleaned data is written into 'cleaned.txt' in the format: professor_name - course_1|course_2|...course_n
4. The cleaned dataset is used by 'query.py' to answer 3 queries:
	1: How many distinct courses does this dataset contain?
	2: List all the courses (in alphabetical order) taught by Professor Mitchell Theys in
	comma-separated form.
	3: For professors who have taught at least 5 courses, using Jaccard distance to
	determine which two professors have the most aligned teaching interests based on course
	titles. Note that you should implement the function to calculate Jaccard distance
	instead of using an existing package.
